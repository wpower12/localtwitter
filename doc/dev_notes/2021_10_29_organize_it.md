# 2021-10-29 - packaging. to. packaging.

## Goals

* Get the script into a state where it can be run from a few exported commands?
* Not sure what that will look like. 

## Got it.
The `localtwitter` package is organized now. I think I actually organized one correctly finally. I even used the `__all__` variable in the `__init__.py` file.
