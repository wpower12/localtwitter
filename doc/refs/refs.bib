	abstract = {In the era of Big Data, the Internet has become one of the main data sources: Data can be collected for relatively low costs and can be used for a wide range of purposes. To be able to timely support solid decisions in any ﬁeld, it is essential to increase data production efﬁciency, data accuracy, and reliability. In this framework, our paper aims at identifying an optimized and ﬂexible method to collect and, at the same time, geolocate social media information over a whole country. In particular, the target of this paper is to compare three alternative methods to collect data from the social media Twitter. This is achieved considering four main comparison criteria: Collection time, dataset size, pre-processing phase load, and geographic distribution. Our ﬁndings regarding Great Britain identify one of these methods as the best option, since it is able to collect both the highest number of tweets per hour and the highest percentage of unique tweets per hour. Furthermore, this method reduces the computational effort needed to pre-process the collected tweets (e.g., showing the lowest collection times and the lowest number of duplicates within the geographical areas) and enhances the territorial coverage (if compared to the population distribution). At the same time, the effort required to set up this method is feasible and less prone to the arbitrary decisions of the researcher.},

	abstract = {Brexit i.e. “British Exit” is one of the major events in the history of economics and British politics. When EU referendum took place, 52\% of votes were in favor of United Kingdom leaving the European Union. This was a major event affecting the overall economy of Britain and was also one of the most talked about events. Twitter is a social network platform where users from all over the world discussed a lot about Brexit and British politics. Analysis of such user generated text can reveal a lot about the event and what people think of it. Sentiment analysis is a trending technique to get insights from any written text. Our aim in this study is to analyze the tweets geospatially and then perform Geo-spatial Sentiment analysis based on the location of the events verses the geospatial tweets distribution for that particular event on global level. Also shows the keywords and hashtags were mostly used by people during that time and how they were being used i.e. which hashtag was used positively, which one was used negatively and which one carried neutral sentiment with itself. This study also tries to find out the British politicians who were being talked about the most and what people think of them sentimentally. Also, the tweets intended for these famous British politicians are analyzed geospatially and their sentiment distribution is visualized. The geospatial sentiment analysis of the whole dataset for “leave” and “remain” tags is also plotted on the atlas map.},

	abstract = {Hyper-dense wireless network deployment is one of the popular solutions to meeting high capacity requirement for 5G delivery. However, current operator understanding of consumer satisfaction comes from call centers and base station quality-of-service (QoS) reports with poor geographic accuracy. The dramatic increase in geo-tagged social media posts adds a new potential to understand consumer satisfaction towards target-speciﬁc quality-of-experience (QoE) topics. In our paper, we focus on evaluating users’ opinion on wireless service-related topics by applying natural language processing (NLP) to geo-tagged Twitter data. Current generalized sentiment detection methods with generalized NLP corpora are not topic speciﬁc. Here, we develop a novel wireless service topic-speciﬁc sentiment framework, yielding higher targeting accuracy than generalized NLP frameworks. To do so, we ﬁrst annotate a new sentiment corpus called SignalSentiWord (SSW) and compare its performance with two other popular corpus libraries, AFINN and SentiWordNet. We then apply three established machine learning methods, namely: Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to build our topic-speciﬁc sentiment classiﬁer. Furthermore, we discuss the capability of SSW to ﬁlter noisy and high-frequency irrelevant words to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Finally, the real-world testing results show that our proposed SSW improves the performance of NLP signiﬁcantly.},

	abstract = {The investigation of human activity patterns from location-based social networks like Twitter is an established approach of how to infer relationships and latent information that characterize urban structures. Researchers from various disciplines have performed geospatial analysis on social media data despite the data’s high dimensionality, complexity and heterogeneity. However, user-generated datasets are of multi-scale nature, which results in limited applicability of commonly known geospatial analysis methods. Therefore in this paper, we propose a geographic, hierarchical self-organizing map (Geo-H-SOM) to analyze geospatial, temporal and semantic characteristics of georeferenced tweets. The results of our method, which we validate in a case study, demonstrate the ability to explore, abstract and cluster high-dimensional geospatial and semantic information from crowdsourced data.},

	abstract = {The study of migrations and mobility has historically been severely limited by the absence of reliable data or the temporal sparsity of the available data. Using geospatial digital trace data, the study of population movements can be much more precisely and dynamically measured. Our research seeks to develop a near real-time (one-day lag) Twitter census that gives a more temporally granular picture of local and non-local population at the county level. Leveraging geotagged tweets to determine the home location of all active Twitter users, we contribute to the field of digital and computational demography by obtaining accurate daily Twitter population stocks (residents and nonresidents). Internal validation reveals over 80\% of accuracy when compared with users self-reported home location. External validation results suggest these stocks correlate with available statistics of residents/non-residents at the county level and can accurately reflect regular (seasonal tourism) and non-regular events such as the Great American Solar Eclipse of 2017. The findings demonstrate that Twitter holds potential to introduce the dynamic component often lacking in population estimates.},
